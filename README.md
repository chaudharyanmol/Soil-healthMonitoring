The Soil Health Monitoring System uses machine learning to analyze soil data such as pH, moisture, and nutrient levels. It provides insights into soil quality, helping farmers make informed decisions on irrigation and fertilization. This system promotes better soil management, leading to improved crop yields and sustainable farming practices.


# Introduction
Agriculture is a crucial sector in India, providing livelihood to around 70% of the population, with 72% of the people living in rural areas. Soil fertility plays a vital role in agricultural productivity by supporting plant growth and ensuring the availability of essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Various factors such as soil anatomy, microbial activity, climate, and human practices influence soil health, which directly impacts crop yields. Traditional methods of soil analysis are often slow and labor-intensive, highlighting the need for modern techniques like machine learning to optimize soil management.

This project proposes a machine learning-based soil health monitoring system using the LightGBM classifier to assess soil fertility. By analyzing key soil attributes like organic matter, pH level, microbial activity, and nutrient content, the system aims to provide actionable insights to farmers, helping them make better decisions for sustainable farming practices. The model, validated through cross-validation techniques, shows superior performance in predicting soil health compared to traditional methods, offering a promising approach to improve soil management and increase crop yields.
